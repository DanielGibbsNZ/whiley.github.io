{"name":"Whiley","tagline":"Whiley Developer Website","body":"# Whiley\r\nWhiley is a programming language particularly suited to safety-critical systems. It is a hybrid object-oriented and functional programming language which employs extended static checking to eliminate errors at compile time, including divide-by-zero, array out-of-bounds and null dereference errors.\r\n\r\nWhiley compiles to the Java Virtual Machine and is fully inter-operable with existing Java applications.  Whiley will operate on any system that can run Java including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Whiley is released under the New BSD License.\r\n\r\nTo find out more, visit [http://whiley.org](http://whiley.org).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to get started with Whiley:\r\n\r\n1. Install the Eclipse Plugin.\r\n\r\n2. Download and run the Executable Jar.\r\n\r\n3. Download and setup the Whiley Development Kit.\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse plugin is the easiest way to get started with Whiley (see instructions below). If you don't use Eclipse, another simple option is to download and run the executable Jar. Finally, developers may\r\nlike to download the Whiley Development Kit (WDK), which includes the source code for the compiler/runtime and various scripts to simplify compiling and running Whiley programs from the command-line.\r\n\r\n## Whiley Eclipse Plugin (Wyclipse)\r\n\r\nTo install the Whiley Eclipse plugin start Eclipse and select \"Install New Software\" (normally found under \"Help\"). Then, add http://whiley.org/eclipse as a \"software site\", after which you should find that \"Whiley Eclipse Plugin\" becomes an option to install. At this point, \"select all\" and follow the instructions to install the plugin.\r\n\r\nFor more info on Wyclipse, see [http://whiley.org/tools/wyclipse/](http://whiley.org/tools/wyclipse/).\r\n\r\n## Whiley Executable Jar\r\n\r\nFirst, download the most recent stable version of the executable jar (`wyjc-all-vX.Y.Z.jar` where vX.Y.Z is the version number) from [http://whiley.org/downloads](http://whiley.org/downloads). Then you can compile Whiley files as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% cd examples\r\n% java -jar wyjc-all-vX.Y.Z.jar -bp wyjc-all-vX.Y.Z.jar hello-world.whiley\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the Whiley program has successfully been compiled, you can run it as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% java -cp \"wyjc-all-vX.Y.Z.jar;.\" hello-world\r\nHello World\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** under Mac OS and UNIX you will want to replace the `;` with a `:`.\r\n\r\n## Whiley Development Kit\r\n\r\nTo install the Whiley Development Kit, first download the latest stable version from [http://whiley.org/downloads](http://whiley.org/downloads). Then, unpack the tarball into an appropriate directory (as you've probably already done). You then need to make sure that `PATH` environment variable points to the `bin` directory, where several scripts are provided for running Whiley. (Don't worry if you don't know what the `PATH` is, as you can instead run the jar directly - see below).\r\n\r\nWith the `PATH` setup correctly, you should be able to run the `wyjc` command to compile Whiley programs as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% cd examples\r\n% wyjc hello-world.whiley\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can run the program using the `wyj` command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% wyj hello-world\r\nHello World\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** the wyj command is just a wrapper for `java -cp lib/wyrt-vX.Y.Z.jar`.\r\n\r\nIf you're running on a Windows system without cygwin, or you're having trouble getting the `wyjc` script to work, then a useful alternative is to run the jar file directly. You can do this as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% cd examples\r\n% java -jar ../lib/wyjc-vX.Y.Z.jar -bp ../lib/wyrt-vX.Y.Z.jar hello-world.whiley\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, to run the program you would do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% java -cp \"../lib/wyrt-vX.Y.Z.jar;.\" hello-world\r\nHello World\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** under Mac OS and UNIX you will want to replace the `;` with a `:`.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
